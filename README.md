# Liphium Chat

Liphium Chat is a novel approach to the design and feature set of a chat app. While it looks very similar and functions very similar to all other chat apps on the market right now, there are a lot of useful additions and little tweaks that help you out every day. 

**Have 5 GB of footage you need to send to one of your friends?** No problem, you can stream files straight to your friends with Zap Share (like AirDrop or Quick Share over the internet). 

**Want to play any kinds of board games online?** With Tabletop you can play any kind of card or board game online, right inside of the app.

**Want to share a call with all of your friends?** Put it into your status and everyone in your friends list can see and join it, without ever navigating to your conversation, all right within the sidebar.

Liphium Chat is not a new kind of chat app. It's just what all other chat apps have always been missing. And the new ideas for features don't stop here, Liphium is only in it's Alpha after all. You can also learn more about the app on the [website](https://liphium.com).

## This repository

Everything you can see in this repository are services that, together, power the Liphium app. For using Liphium, you need to have this installed on some VPS in the cloud or even your own home server. How to do that and what to look out for is available in [our documentation](https://liphium.com/docs/town-setup/docker). There is currently only a guide for installing it with Docker. But since that's the best way for now, you'll just have to get used to Docker.
