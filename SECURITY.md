# Liphium security policy

## Update policy

We only support the latest version with security updates, but we don't give you any guarantee that libcgc is secure. Use it at your own risk.

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you've discovered a security, I'd appreciate it if you reported it to me. 
You can find me on the [Liphium Discord Server](https://liphium.dev/discord) or send me an [E-Mail](mailto:julian@liphium.dev).
**Please do not make a public issue about it as anyone could then abuse it before it's fixed.**

I try to fix vulnerabilities as quickly as possible, but please give me at least 90 days since this isn't my main job and I only
do this on a voluntary basis. Thanks for understanding.
